While OpenStack began as a platform for managing compute resources represented as virtual machines, now it provides wide abilities to run the workloads in multiple forms, including VM-based, bare-metal, containerized and hybrid models. To this end folks from the OpenStack and Kubernetes communities have been working together to build Kubernetes’ awareness of the capabilities of the underlying cloud when running on OpenStack, ultimately providing an ideal platform for modern containerized applications while they themselves remain agnostic of the underlying infrastructure. \n\nIn this session we will review what OpenStack is at a high level, what are the benefits of running Kubernetes on OpenStack today, and the integration opportunities that mean you are even more likely to want to run Kubernetes on OpenStack in the future! Attend this session to learn how and why you would use Kubernetes and OpenStack to modernize your application delivery and management.

Every decision we make will have long-term implications.

The talk covers the main aspects of data collecting processes altogether with further implications for data processing, highlighting appropriate solutions and architectures for the particular use-cases.

How could anyone not like them \u00af(\u30c4)/\u00af?\n\nThis talk is an overdose of smileys, because they're the perfect excuse to get started with Polymer. Polymer is a library built on top of the Web Components standards that helps developers create reusable components for the modern web. And since I know that everybody has been wondering how one could take over the world by creating a suite of Polymer animated emoticon components, we're going to do exactly that.",
